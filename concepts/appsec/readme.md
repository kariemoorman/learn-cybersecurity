      <li>Threat Modeling: 
        <ul>
          <li>Identify: APIs, Business flows, Data, Access Paths</li>
          <li>Assess: Vulnerabilities, Logic flaws, Access controls, 3rd party risk</li>
          <li>Probability: Examine likelihood of attack</li>
          <li>Impact: Understand Damage, Loss, Consequences of attack</li>
          <li>Mitigation: Develop a plan to address the risk</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Policy: </b>Engineering process (e.g., dev & deploy), API documentation, Style guides</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Design Guides: Promote Governance, Consistency</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Authentication: type (basic, token, certificate), how to implement</li>
          <li>Authorization: Who has access to what, Enforcement policies</li>
          <li>Naming Conventions: URIs as nouns, Methods as verbs, Pluralization, Hierarchy, Case, Language, No jargon/abbreviations</li>
          <li>Error Codes: Status codes, Reference ID, Human readable messages</li>
          <li>Versioning: When to implement vs. not, Version types</li>
          <li>Units, Formats, Standards: Date/time formats, Timezones</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <b>Testing: Ensuring APIs are Free from Flaws</b> </summary>

<ul>
  <li><b>API-First Testing: </b> Evaluate the API layer independent from the Web/Mobile App layer.</li>
  <li><b>API Pentesting Regiment:</b> Reconnaissance, Scanning, Endpoint Analysis, Authentication, Authorization, Assets Management, Injection, Mass Assignment, Rate-Limiting</li>
  <li><b>PenTesting Categories:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>API Security: Unsecure Endpoints, Authentication exploits, Enumeration, DOS & Rate-limiting, Missing TLS/SSL issues, Fuzzing/Injection, Fuzzing/Input validation, Server-side resource forgery, Server properties leaks</li>
      <li>Data Security: Access Control, Excessive/Sensitive data exposure, PII/PHI/PCI-DSS data, File/Directory exposure, Encryption At-Rest, Data exfiltration</li>

    </ul>
</ul>

</details>

<details>

  <li><b>Limitations of Monitoring:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Difficult to get full visibility: Requires sensors at every network segment</li>
      <li>High false-positive rate on threat detection: Live traffic contains limited context</li>
      <li>SaaS-based monitoring requres data share with 3rd parties: Increased privacy concern, bandwidth requirements</li>
      <li>Traffic-blocking solutions (e.g., firewalls) add latency</li>
    </ul>

### Securing API Servers 

 <details>
  <summary> <b>‚öîÔ∏è CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)</b> </summary>
   
  <ul>
    <li>CORS is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. CORS defines what responses are allowed (e.g., POST, GET, DELETE), and from where (e.g., UI), using Origins, Credentials, Methods, and Headers. The CORS mechanism supports secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and web servers. </li>
    <li>The Cross Origin Site Policy header governs whether content can be mixed between locations.</li>
    <li>Why use CORS?
      <ul>
        <li>You have an API or web server with assets you want to protect (e.g., user data, intellectual property, branding).</li>
        <li>You don't want anyone to impersonate you.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>CORS Response Headers:
      <ul>
        <li>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</li>
        <li>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</li>
        <li>Access-Control-Expose-Headers</li>
        <li>Access-Control-Max-Age</li>
        <li>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</li>
        <li>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
 </details>

 <details>
  <summary> <b>üõë Error Disclosure</b> </summary>
   
  <ul>
    <li>Handling errors is necessary, however it is important to review the error messaging to ensure you are not giving away information that could make it easier to attack your system. Ideally you want to have a set of error messages for developers to debug the system that is separate from what the end customers see. Design error handling with operational mindset of "how can this be used maliciously."</li>
    <li>Types of Generic Error Messages:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>"Something Went Wrong" (e.g., messages: [{type: "ERROR", key: "", value: "Check the email id."}])</li>
      <li>Brand Approach: "404 + Image" Error for anything you cannot access, whether or not it actually exists. In this way, the end user is not given more information than is necessary (i.e., "unauthorized").</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Error Handling Best Practices:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Do's: Error early, Log the error, Include useful information for developers in the error, Display something specifically crafted for users in the error</li>
      <li>Don'ts: Bypass erros, Expose developer information to customers</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  
</details>

 <details>
  <summary> <b>üí¶ Server Information Leak</b> </summary>
   
  <ul>
    <li>A server information leak is anything that advertises the technology stack to external parties. Typically this advertisement is in the headers, as web servers advertise in headers by default, as well as appliances, caching, and cloud providers.</li>
    <li>Header Analysis:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a client to access the API (nothing cached).</li>
      <li>Headers will be returned in a client or programming language.</li>
      <li>Look for Server, X-Powered-By, X-Version.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  
</details>
 
 <details>
  <summary> <b>üç™ Insecure Cookies</b> </summary>
   
  <ul>
    <li>Insecure cookies are cookies stored without restrictive security settings, as well as including unecessary information within the cookie. Because cookies are cumulative, it will keep as much information sent from the server in an additive manner.</li>
    <li>Cookie Decoding: Find interesting keys/fields, Sort data types (e.g., Unique ID string, Numeric ID, Booleans, Encoded data), Decoding data (e.g., Delimiters, Base64 decode)</li>
    <li>Cookie Issues:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Cookie forgine/Fuzzing (Trusting cookie data)</li>
      <li>Data harvesting, different site (http only + no domains)</li>
      <li>Data harvesting via XSS (http only)</li>
      <li>Data harvesting in-transit (secure flag)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Solutions:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Treat cookies as untrusted user data.</li>
      <li>Be restrictive on what data is stored in cookies.</li>
      <li>Analyze cookies from an offensive mindset.</li>
      <li>Add timeout on cookies.</li>
      <li>Add HTTP Only flag to prevent JS from other sites reading the cookies.</li>
      <li>Set a secure flag so that the cookie can't be read in-transit.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  
</details>

 <details>
  <summary> <b>üõ§Ô∏è Path Traversal</b> </summary>
   
  <ul>
    <li>Path traversal is anything that allows an attacker access to unintented paths on a server (e.g., /etc/passwd). This includes directory traversal and direct file access/reference.</li>
    <li>Common Painpoints: Dynamic file-includes which introduce runtime vulnerabilities, Loose Spec "str", Input data validation, Server config (e.g., Directory listings, Allowed include paths)</li>
    <li>Solutions:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Input Sanitization: Specify what is allowed (ENUM, Array, List). Don't try to filter out bad.  Harden specs (e.g., max string length).</li>
      <li>Disable server directory listings.</li>
      <li>Don't store anything sensitive at web root (e.g., env configs, readme's, .git, .rsa).</li>
      <li>Hardening server configurations. Put web root on a separate drive from system.</li>
      <li>Remove variables from paths in source code.</li>
      <li>When in doubt, return ERROR.</li>
      <li>Defensive coding.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  
</details>

 <details>
  <summary> <b>‚è≤Ô∏è Rate-Limiting</b> </summary>
   
  <ul>
    <li>Rate-limiting involves setting limitations on inbound requests to ensure service availability and reliability, as well as budgetary restrictions.</li>
    <li>Solutions:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Set RateLimit Headers: RateLimit-Limit: 10, RateLimit-Remaining: 1, RateLimit-Reset: 7.</li>
      <li>HTTP Status: 429 (too many requests)</li>
      <li>Scope: User, Origin, Global, Resource, Endpoint</li>
      <li>Server-Side Throttling</li>
      <li>Limiting in Layers: Gateway/Network Appliance, Service, Server, Endpoint, User, Client Signature, Quota, Logic</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Additional Tips:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid using relational SQL operations to manage throttling.</li>
      <li>Avoid using disk operations.</li>
      <li>Include IP with User.</li>
      <li>Use cache where appropriate (e.g., same query). Example throttle solution: memcache-style (key = user, value = scope, TTL, time frame of throttle). Example cache solution: memcache/key-value store (key = query hash, value = result, TTL = short time window).</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

    <td valign='top'>Prompt Injection</td>
    <td valign='top'>Prompt Injection Vulnerability occurs when an attacker manipulates a large language model (LLM) through crafted inputs, causing the LLM to unknowingly execute the attacker‚Äôs intentions. This can be done directly by ‚Äújailbreaking‚Äù the system prompt or indirectly through manipulated external inputs, potentially leading to data exfiltration, social engineering, and other issues. 
      <br> - Direct Prompt Injections, also known as ‚Äújailbreaking‚Äù, occur when a malicious user overwrites or reveals the underlying system prompt. This may allow attackers to exploit backend systems by interacting with insecure functions and data stores accessible through the LLM. 
      <br> - Indirect Prompt Injections occur when an LLM accepts input from external sources that can be controlled by an attacker, such as websites or files. The attacker may embed a prompt injection in the external content hijacking the conversation context. This would cause LLM output steering to become less stable, allowing the attacker to either manipulate the user or additional systems that the LLM can access. Additionally, indirect prompt injections do not need to be human-visible/readable, as long as the text is parsed by the LLM.</td>

    <td valign='top'>
      - A malicious user crafts a direct prompt injection to the LLM, which instructs it to ignore the application creator‚Äôs system prompts and instead execute a prompt that returns private, dangerous, or otherwise undesirable information. 
      <br>- A user employs an LLM to summarize a webpage containing an indirect prompt injection. This then causes the LLM to solicit sensitive information from the user and perform exfiltration via JavaScript or Markdown. 
      <br> - A user enables a plugin linked to an e-commerce site. A rogue instruction embedded on a visited website exploits this plugin, leading to unauthorized purchases. 
      <br> - A rogue instruction and content embedded on a visited website exploits other plugins to scam users. 
      <br> - A malicious user uploads a resume containing an indirect prompt injection. The document contains a prompt injection with instructions to make the LLM inform users that this document is excellent eg. an excellent candidate for a job role. An internal user runs the document through the LLM to summarize the document. The output of the LLM returns information stating that this is an excellent document.</td>
    <td valign='top'>
      - Enforce privilege control on LLM access to backend systems (least privilege). Provide the LLM with its own API tokens for extensible functionality, such as plugins, data access, and function-level permissions. 
      <br> - Add a human in the loop for extended functionality (e.g., performing privileged operations, such as sending or deleting emails). This reduces the opportunity for indirect prompt injections that can lead to unauthorized actions on behalf of a user without their knowledge or consent. 
      <br> - Segregate external content from user prompts. Denote where untrusted content is being used to limit their influence on user prompts. 
      <br> - Establish (zero) trust boundaries between the LLM, external sources, and extensible functionality (e.g., plugins or downstream functions). Treat the LLM as an untrusted user and maintain final user control on decision-making processes. Highlight potentially untrustworthy responses visually to the user. 
      <br> - Manually monitor LLM input and output to check that it is as expected. This aids in detecting and addressing weaknesses.</td>
