# Nmap

[Nmap](https://nmap.org/) (i.e., "Network Mapper") is a powerful open-source network scanning and exploration tool designed to discover hosts, services, and vulnerabilities on a computer network.
Nmap can identify the operating system of a target host as well as versions of services running on open ports based on characteristics of the network responses; information that is valuable for identifying potential vulnerabilities.
Nmap also allows users ability to execute custom scripts to automate tasks, conduct more advanced tests, or perform specific checks (e.g., vulnerability detection).
