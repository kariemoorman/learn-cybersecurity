## GDPR 

[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/)

GDPR is a comprehensive data protection and privacy regulation that was implemented by the European Union (EU) on May 25, 2018, replacing the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. GDPR emphasizes accountability, requiring organizations to demonstrate compliance and transparency in their data processing activities. GPDR grants individuals various rights, such as the right to access, rectification, erasure, and the right to be forgotten. Any organization handling EU citizens' data, regardless of its location, must comply.

GDPR guards personal data from the collection process. Businesses are only allowed to collect personal data if there is a legitimate reason for doing so, and are required to inform the data subject on how their data would be processed. Companies are also required to implement privacy by design for all new systems and processes; adequate cybersecurity measures should be implemented at all times, including having PII encrypted. When necessary, GDPR recommends businesses assign a data protection officer to handle GDPR compliance.

Country of Origin: European Union  
Effective Date: 25 May 2018  
Establishing Body: European Parliament & Council of the European Union

Purpose:
- Obtain consent before collecting personal data of EU residents.
- Keep stored personal data at a minimum.
- Protect stored personal data with adequate measures.

What is "personal data" under GDPR? 
- GDPR Article 4: "any piece of information that relates to a living, identifiable person," where identifier includes referents such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person (i.e., humans, not companies).
- Recital 30: "Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them."
- GDPR only applies to personal data processed in one of two ways:
  - Personal data processed wholly or partly by automated means (or, information in electronic form); and
  - Personal data processed in a non-automated manner which forms part of, or is intended to form part of, a ‘filing system’ (or, written records in a manual filing system).

Who must comply?
- Any business entity that does business in the EU.
- Any business entity that monitors, collects, or stores personal data of EU residents.
  
What are the penalties for non-compliance? 
- There exists two tiers of GDPR fines:
    - Tier 1: Failure in having proper database security measures in place, usually revealed following a data breach. The maximum tier 1 fine is set at 2% of a company’s global revenue or 10 million euros, whichever is greater.
    - Tier 2: Related to data collection and usage, punishing companies who fail to obtain consent before collecting and processing personal data. The maximum tier 2 fine is 4% of a company’s global revenue or 20 million euros, whichever is greater.

## CCPA

[California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)

CCPA grants California state residents specific rights regarding their personal information, such as the right to know, delete, and opt-out of the sale of their data. Businesses are required to disclose the categories of personal information they collect and the purposes for which it is used.

Country of Origin: United States (California)  
Effective Date: 1 January 2020  
Establishing Body: California State Legislature

What privacy rights are secured for California residents?
- The right to know about the personal information a business collects about them and how it is used and shared;
- The right to delete personal information collected from them (with some exceptions);
- The right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information; and
- The right to non-discrimination for exercising their CCPA rights.
- As of 1 January 2023:
  - The right to correct inaccurate personal information that a business has about them; and
  - The right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information collected about them.  
*(Source: https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)*

What is personal information and sensitive personal personal information under CCPA?
- Personal Information: Information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked with you or your household, e.g., your name, social security number, email address, records of products purchased, internet browsing history, geolocation data, fingerprints, and inferences from other personal information that could create a profile about your preferences and characteristics.
- Sensitive Information: Subset of personal information that includes certain government identifiers (e.g., social security numbers); account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number with any required security code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account; precise geolocation; contents of mail, email, and text messages; genetic data; biometric information processed to identify a consumer; information concerning a consumer’s health, sex life, or sexual orientation; or information about racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, or union membership. 

Who must comply?
- The CCPA applies to for-profit businesses that do business in California and meet any of the following:
  - Have a gross annual revenue of over $25 million;
  - Buy, sell, or share the personal information of 100,000 or more California residents, households, or devices; or
  - Derive 50% or more of their annual revenue from selling California residents’ personal information.
- The CCPA generally does not apply to nonprofit organizations or government agencies.

What is considered non-compliance?
- Not informing consumers of their rights.
- Not enabling disclosure requests.
- Discriminating against consumers.
- Charging consumers a fee to consumers who exercise their rights under the CCPA.
- Not providing electronic consumer information in a way that isn’t in a “portable and, to the extent technically feasible, in a readily useable format” (e.g., via email).
- Not updating privacy policies and websites to reflect categories of personal information collected, including a conspicuous link called “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” by which consumers may opt out.
- Not responding to a consumer request within 45 days.

What are the penalties for non-compliance? 
- The Attorney General has discretion in the actual amount per-violation. The Attorney General may take civil action, including imposing an injunction and a civil penalty of $2,500 for each violation. If the violation is considered to be intentional then that might rise to $7,500 for each violation. These penalties from the Attorney General are widely understood to apply to each consumer (e.g., if 1,000 consumers are affected, and the penalty per violation equates to $7500, the civil penalty amounts to $7.5 million).
