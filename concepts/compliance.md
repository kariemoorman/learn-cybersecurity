## GDPR 

[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/)

GDPR is a comprehensive data protection and privacy regulation that was implemented by the European Union (EU) on May 25, 2018, replacing the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. GDPR emphasizes accountability, requiring organizations to demonstrate compliance and transparency in their data processing activities. GPDR grants individuals various rights, such as the right to access, rectification, erasure, and the right to be forgotten. Any organization handling EU citizens' data, regardless of its location, must comply.

GDPR guards personal data from the collection process. Businesses are only allowed to collect personal data if there is a legitimate reason for doing so, and are required to inform the data subject on how their data would be processed. Companies are also required to implement privacy by design for all new systems and processes; adequate cybersecurity measures should be implemented at all times, including having PII encrypted. When necessary, GDPR recommends businesses assign a data protection officer to handle GDPR compliance.

Country of Origin: European Union  
Effective Date: 25 May 2018  
Establishing Body: European Parliament & Council of the European Union

Purpose:
- Obtain consent before collecting personal data of EU residents.
- Keep stored personal data at a minimum.
- Protect stored personal data with adequate measures.

What is "personal data" under GDPR? 
- GDPR Article 4: "any piece of information that relates to a living, identifiable person," where identifier includes referents such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person (i.e., humans, not companies).
- Recital 30: "Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them."
- GDPR only applies to personal data processed in one of two ways:
  - Personal data processed wholly or partly by automated means (or, information in electronic form); and
  - Personal data processed in a non-automated manner which forms part of, or is intended to form part of, a ‘filing system’ (or, written records in a manual filing system).

Who must comply?
- Any business entity that does business in the EU.
- Any business entity that monitors, collects, or stores personal data of EU residents.
  
What are the penalties for non-compliance? 
- There exists two tiers of GDPR fines:
    - Tier 1: Failure in having proper database security measures in place, usually revealed following a data breach. The maximum tier 1 fine is set at 2% of a company’s global revenue or 10 million euros, whichever is greater.
    - Tier 2: Related to data collection and usage, punishing companies who fail to obtain consent before collecting and processing personal data. The maximum tier 2 fine is 4% of a company’s global revenue or 20 million euros, whichever is greater.

  - Have a gross annual revenue of over $25 million;
  - Buy, sell, or share the personal information of 100,000 or more California residents, households, or devices; or
  - Derive 50% or more of their annual revenue from selling California residents’ personal information.
- The CCPA generally does not apply to nonprofit organizations or government agencies.

What is considered non-compliance?
- Not informing consumers of their rights.
- Not enabling disclosure requests.
- Discriminating against consumers.
- Charging consumers a fee to consumers who exercise their rights under the CCPA.
- Not providing electronic consumer information in a way that isn’t in a “portable and, to the extent technically feasible, in a readily useable format” (e.g., via email).

What are the penalties for non-compliance? 
- The Attorney General has discretion in the actual amount per-violation. The Attorney General may take civil action, including imposing an injunction and a civil penalty of $2,500 for each violation. If the violation is considered to be intentional then that might rise to $7,500 for each violation. These penalties from the Attorney General are widely understood to apply to each consumer (e.g., if 1,000 consumers are affected, and the penalty per violation equates to $7500, the civil penalty amounts to $7.5 million).

## HIPAA

[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html)

HIPAA is a US federal law meant to safeguard health information when it is maintained or transmitted electronically. HIPAA requires adherence to national standards for protecting sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient’s consent or knowledge. HIPAA is broken into two component parts: HIPAA Privacy Rule, which protects PHI data, and HIPAA Security Rule, which protects e-PHI data. 

The Privacy Rule defines Protected Health Information (PHI), stipulates permissible uses and disclosures, lists the circumstances in which an authorization is required, and gives individuals rights over their PHI. The Security Rule deals with the subset of PHI that is created, collected, used, maintained, or transmitted electronically (ePHI), and includes three sets of safeguards that must be complied with by covered entities and business associates: Administrative (e.g., risk analyses, workforce clearance, security training, access management, and contingency planning), Physical (e.g., physical access to devices maintaining ePHI, device security, data back-ups, and secure disposal of data and devices), and Technical (e.g., password management, automatic logoff, data encryption, audit controls, and transmission security).

Country of Origin: United States  
Effective Date: 21 August 1996  
Establishing Body: United States Congress  

What is PHI (Protected Health Information)? 
- Protected Health Information means "individually identifiable health information transmitted by electronic media, maintained in electronic media, or transmitted or maintained in any other form or medium.”
- Any information, including genetic information, whether oral or recorded in any form or medium, that:  
   “Is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, public health authority, employer, life insurer, school or university, or health care clearinghouse; and relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual.”
- PHI includes any health information relating a patient´s condition, the past, present, or future provision of healthcare, or payment thereof. It becomes individually identifiable health information when identifiers are included in the same designated record set, and it becomes protected when it is transmitted or maintained in any form (by a covered entity).
- Individually identifiable health information includes "demographic information collected from an individual [that] is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, employer, or health care clearinghouse […] and that identifies the individual or […] can be used to identify the individual.”


Who must comply?
- "Covered Entities":
  - Healthcare providers: "Every healthcare provider, regardless of size of practice, who electronically transmits health information in connection with certain transactions. These transactions include: Claims, Benefit eligibility inquiries, Referral authorization requests, Other transactions for which HHS has established standards under the HIPAA Transactions Rule."
  - Health plans: "Health, dental, vision, and prescription drug insurers, Health maintenance organizations (HMOs), Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare+Choice, and Medicare supplement insurers, Long-term care insurers (excluding nursing home fixed-indemnity policies), Employer-sponsored group health plans, Government- and church-sponsored health plans, Multi-employer health plans."
    - Exception: A group health plan with fewer than 50 participants that is administered solely by the employer that established and maintains the plan is not a covered entity.
  - Healthcare clearinghouses: "Entities that process nonstandard information they receive from another entity into a standard (i.e., standard format or data content), or vice versa. In most instances, healthcare clearinghouses will receive individually identifiable health information only when they are providing these processing services to a health plan or healthcare provider as a business associate."
- Business Associates:
  - "A person or organization (other than a member of a covered entity’s workforce) using or disclosing individually identifiable health information to perform or provide functions, activities, or services for a covered entity.These functions, activities, or services include: Claims processing, Data analysis, Utilization review, Billing."


How to comply with HIPAA Privacy Rule?


How to comply with HIPAA Security Rule?
- To comply with the HIPAA Security Rule, all covered entities must:
  - Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all e-PHI
  - Detect and safeguard against anticipated threats to the security of the information
  - Protect against anticipated impermissible uses or disclosures that are not allowed by the rule
  - Certify compliance by their workforce
