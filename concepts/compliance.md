## GDPR 

[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/)

GDPR is a comprehensive data protection and privacy regulation that was implemented by the European Union (EU) on May 25, 2018, replacing the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. GDPR emphasizes accountability, requiring organizations to demonstrate compliance and transparency in their data processing activities. GPDR grants individuals various rights, such as the right to access, rectification, erasure, and the right to be forgotten. Any organization handling EU citizens' data, regardless of its location, must comply.

GDPR guards personal data from the collection process. Businesses are only allowed to collect personal data if there is a legitimate reason for doing so, and are required to inform the data subject on how their data would be processed. Companies are also required to implement privacy by design for all new systems and processes; adequate cybersecurity measures should be implemented at all times, including having PII encrypted. When necessary, GDPR recommends businesses assign a data protection officer to handle GDPR compliance.

Country of Origin: European Union  
Effective Date: May 25, 2018  
Establishing Body: European Parliament & Council of the European Union

Purpose:
- Obtain consent before collecting personal data of EU residents.
- Keep stored personal data at a minimum.
- Protect stored personal data with adequate measures.

What is "personal data" under GDPR? 
- GDPR Article 4: "any piece of information that relates to a living, identifiable person," where identifier includes referents such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person (i.e., humans, not companies).
- Recital 30: "Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them."
- GDPR only applies to personal data processed in one of two ways:
  - Personal data processed wholly or partly by automated means (or, information in electronic form); and
  - Personal data processed in a non-automated manner which forms part of, or is intended to form part of, a ‘filing system’ (or, written records in a manual filing system).

Who must comply?
- Any business entity that does business in the EU.
- Any business entity that monitors, collects, or stores personal data of EU residents.
  
What are the penalties for non-compliance? 
- There exists two tiers of GDPR fines:
    - Tier 1: Failure in having proper database security measures in place, usually revealed following a data breach. The maximum tier 1 fine is set at 2% of a company’s global revenue or 10 million euros, whichever is greater.
    - Tier 2: Related to data collection and usage, punishing companies who fail to obtain consent before collecting and processing personal data. The maximum tier 2 fine is 4% of a company’s global revenue or 20 million euros, whichever is greater.
